# Mission-to-Mars

## A written report on the Mission to Mars analysis.

The purpose of this repository was to create a webpage to display all the information we scrapped from different websites showcasing information about the planet Mars.


Provided on the following images, you can see we were able to scrape the latest Mars news that will include an image. That information will be updated with the latest information every time you click on the “Scrape New Data” button on the top of the page.
